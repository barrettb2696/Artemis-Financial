# Artemis-Financial

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

  Artemis Financial was centered around securing their financial software application that handled sensitive client data such as savings, investments, and insurance information.  They wanted to address potential threats and attacks associated with their software security requirements, ensuring secure communications, handling international transactions securely, complying with governmental regulations, and modernizing their operations to stay ahead of threats.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

    By conducting a manual review and static testing, it allowed me to effectively identify vulnerabilities in the codebase, highlighting areas for improvement to enhance the overall security posture of the application.  Coding securely is essential because it mitigates the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and other cyber-attacks that could compromise sensitive information.  Software security adds to a company's overall wellbeing by protecting the company's data, preserving its reputation, avoiding legal repercussions, and fostering trust with customers.  

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  One of the challenging aspects was ensuring comprehensive coverage across all potential attack vectors and identifying subtle vulnerabilities that could be easily overlooked.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  To increase layers of security, measures such as input validation, API security, code quality improvement, proper error handling, and encryption were implemented.  Leveraging automated vulnerability scanning tools and continuous monitoring systems could further enhance security posture by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in real-time.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  After refactoring the code to address identified vulnerabilities, thorough testing procedures, including static testing and code reviews, would be essential to ensure that new vulnerabilities haven't been intoduced inadvertently.  Implementing a robust change management process can help track and verify changes made to the codebase, ensuring that security remains intact as well.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  The resources, tools, and coding practices utilized in this assessment that were useful to me includes the dependency-check plug-in for Maven, manual code review techniques, and adherence to secure coding principles.  These practices promote a proactive approach to security and help instill a culture of security awareness within development teams.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  This assignment demonstrates the ability to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities and an understanding of software security principles.  It provides hands-on experience in conducting vulnerability assessments, implementing secure coding practices, and fortifying software applications against potential threats.
